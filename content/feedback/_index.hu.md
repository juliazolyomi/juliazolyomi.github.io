> _I was attending Julia's counseling sessions online. Due to the corona situation, it was not possible for me to visit any praxis personally. The four sessions I took with her helped me a lot to analyze and reconstruct my attitude about the new situations in my life which I was facing. I believe that taking care of our mind and thoughts is like Wellness Therapy. Everybody needs it regularly.\
I realized that in this short time I made better decisions and my friends could also benefit from my better and calmer version. I would recommend Julia's counseling because she is very attentive and helps you with questions to understand better where your problem originates from. We did many helpful exercises, which help me in everyday life as well.\

> _After being frustrated for a while I decided to seek help. She was the best psychologist I have ever met! We all, as humans, need someone to talk to, someone who advises us during these hard days that we are going through.\
I recommend her for everyone.\
Thank you Julia for helping me!_

> _Julia is super sweet! She's very easy to talk to and never has a judgemental tone while talking to you. She helped lower the frequency of my panic attacks within 3 sessions and is still open to talk if I ever need her! She never forced me or insisted that I should follow her every recommendation, she always said it was just an idea that I should consider and thanks to her approach I never felt cornered or forced.\

> _Julia is a very kind and patient person.
I was having problems with stress and anxiety, which I didn’t even realise until I spoke with Julia. She was very attentive to every detail and we were able to figure out aspects of my lifestyle that could be improved for my well being.\
The tips she gave me has helped in my recovery so far, I definitely do feel a lot better than I did before our first session. I feel empowered to help myself get to where I want to be.\
Throughout all our conversations I did feel entirely safe and also trusted her. She created an environment where we could speak about anything. I’m really glad to have spoken to her and will not hesitate to talk to her whenever the need be.\

> _A karantén alatt kerestem fel Júliát a sok múltban összegyűlt dolog miatt, ami az izoláció alatt felszínre tört és a kb. 7-8 alkalom alatt nagyon sok témát tudtunk érinteni és sokat segítettek a beszélgetések abban, hogyan tudok kicsit tudatosabban átvészelni negatív időszakokat, hogy tekintsek az emberi kapcsolataimra, mik fontosak nekem bennük stb. Úgyhogy jó szívvel ajánlom másoknak is őt.\
