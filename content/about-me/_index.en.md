> _As a **psychologist** I believe that with meaningful conversations we can maintain our mental health and protect ourselves, even in difficult life situations. In my work, I strive to resolve the stress, frustration, and anxiety caused by negative thoughts that appear during such periods._

# Introduction

Ever since I was a child, I have been infinitely excited about spending time with other people, talking, listening and observing the reactions of adults. Driven by curiosity, I used to guess what’s going on in people’s minds, why they act differently in a similar situation, and how their emotions change over time. That’s why I decided I wanted to study psychology and dedicated my life to helping others get to know themselves better and cope with the intricacies of life.

I started my career at the Department of Psychology at Eötvös Loránd University, then obtained my master's degree in Clinical Psychology at Leiden University in the Netherlands. The focus of my research during my master’s degree was to understand the neurological background of the rise of negative emotion and the ways to regulate them. Our goal was to develop new coping methods that anyone could effectively apply in emotionally stressful, traumatic situations.

During and since my studies, I have spent a lot of time volunteering, such as working with patients in psychiatric hospitals, people with mental illness, people with intellectual disabilities, people with reduced mobility, alcohol and drug users, people with eating disorders and refugees. I am currently a volunteer psychologist at a social counseling center where I provide psychological help to women working in the sex industry in Austria. In addition, I welcome clients in my private psychological consultation hours.
